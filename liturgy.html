              <br><br>
              Do you have a good voice, musical talent or Choir experience? Now is the time to join St. Philip's Music Ministry and share your gifts with our parish community. We invite you to join our talented parishioners who form our parish choirs. Rehearsals for the Adult Choir are held on Tuesday evenings in the Church Chapel beginning on September 6 from 7 PM to 9 PM. Our Parish Schola of young adult voices has been a great success. We would like to welcome more of our high school, college and young adult parishioners to join this group. Schola rehearsals are held on Tuesday evenings beginning September 6 in the Church Chapel from 6 PM to 7 PM. Please look for fliers at church entrances. School Choir rehearsals will be held after school (3PM to 4PM) on Mondays and Tuesdays. The Choristers Yearly Calendar will be given to interested students the first week of school. Choristers must be able to match pitch and timing and possess good listening skills. Rehearsals will begin on September 12 and 13. Please be considerate of the ministry of the parish musicians and their concentration on the liturgy. Enter the pews from the side aisle and not the window aisle. "If the space occupied by the choir and instruments are visible to the assembly, it must reflect the sacredness of the music ministry."Sing to the Lord!"

          "A professional director of music ministries, or music director, provides a major service by working with the bishop or pastor to oversee the planning, coordination, and ministries of the parish or diocesan liturgical music program. The director of music ministries fosters the active participation of the liturgical assembly in singing; coordinates the preparation of music to be sung at various liturgical celebrations; and promotes the ministries of choirs, psalmists, cantors, organists, and all who play instruments that serve the Liturgy."
          <br><br>
          Since every ministry is rooted in the Sacraments of Initiation, which form the People of God into "a community of disciples formed by and of the mission of Christ," the director of music ministries has a role that "finds its place within the communion of the Church and serves the mission of Christ in the Spirit."<br><br>
          Directors of music ministries and other lay ecclesial ministers exercise their role in relation both to the ordained and to the community of the faithful.

          The RCIA or Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults is the Church's process of journeying with adults in their relationship with God, becoming familiar with Catholic teachings and practices and become acquainted with members of the parish.<br><br>
          Individuals interested in exploring and discerning membership in the Catholic Church meet with our RCIA Team on a weekly basis to discuss these teachings in light of Sacred Scripture and Tradition. This process is for non-Catholics who wish to receive the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Eucharist, However, many who wish to join the Catholic Church have already been baptized in another Christian Church. They will participate in the RCIA process but will not be "re-baptized".<br><br>
          Typically, the process begins in September and runs through the Easter Season with registration in the summer months. However each candidate is looked at individually and depending on personal circumstances other courses toward full communion with the Church are available.<br><br>
          Children over 7 years old who have not received the sacraments of reconciliation and Eucharist are invited to participate in a similar age-related program, please contact the church office for details.
          <br><br>
          This is a wonderful program with a dedicated group of parishioners who make all feel most welcome. If you are interested in more details about becoming a Catholic please contact us today!

          These are volunteers at each Mass who greet parishioners and seat them, if necessary. They assist those who have volunteered to present the gifts of bread and wine, take up the collection and prepare the Church for the next Mass; (placing booklets properly in the pews and collecting parish bulletins that have been left behind.)
